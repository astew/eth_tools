# eth_tools
Some simple python utilities for using the GDAX API. Relies on the GDAX-Python project.

This is just a simple personal project of mine. 

It relies on Coinbase's GDAX exchange platform, and it is centered around using it for ethereum, rather than bitcoin, though it could be fairly easily modified to use either.
